# The while loop represents the game.
# Each iteration represents a turn of the game
# where you are given inputs (the heights of the mountains)
# and where you have to print an output (the index of the mountain to fire on)
# The inputs you are given are automatically updated according to your last actions.

    # Write an action using print
    # To debug: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
    # The index of the mountain to fire on.
